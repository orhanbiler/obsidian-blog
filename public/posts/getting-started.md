# Getting Started with Obsidian Blogging

  

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management tool that can also serve as an excellent blogging platform. In this post, I'll share my experience setting up Obsidian for managing my blog posts.

  

## Why Use Obsidian for Blogging?

  

1. **Powerful Markdown Editor**: Obsidian provides a fantastic Markdown editing experience with live preview.

2. **Local File Storage**: All your posts are stored as local Markdown files.

3. **Linking Between Posts**: Easily create connections between related posts.

4. **Version Control**: Works great with Git for version control.

  

## Key Features

  

### Frontmatter Support

Each post starts with YAML frontmatter that includes:

- Title

- Date

- Tags

- Excerpt

- Draft status

  

### Automatic Syncing

When you save a post in Obsidian, it automatically:

1. Generates a URL-friendly slug

2. Updates the post index

3. Makes it available on your website

  

## Getting Started

  

To create a new post:

1. Use the blog post template

2. Fill in the frontmatter
