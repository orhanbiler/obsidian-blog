# Hello World - My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using Obsidian as my content management system. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here.

## Why I Chose Obsidian

I chose Obsidian for my blog because:
1. It's a powerful Markdown editor
2. It works with local files
3. It has great organization features
4. It integrates well with my development workflow

## What's Next

I plan to write about:
- Web development
- Technology trends
- Personal projects
- Learning experiences

Stay tuned for more content!
